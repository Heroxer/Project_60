        <h1> Hello!!! My Name is Anubhav,<br> Today i am going to tell you my favourite hobby which is Making Portraits!</h1>
         <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I like to make portraits because art is a diverse range of human activities involving the conscious use of creative imagination to express technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.</p>

        <h1>Rohit Sharma <br> <h2>Rohit Sharma has an imposing presence at the crease. Not a Chris Gayle-like personality that destroys the bowlers with an astonishing range of shots, but able to make an impact in his own way. Rohit Sharma, a batsman with a combination of silken drives and robust pulls, can be a subject worthy of a case study on how to convert your energy into a successful career.</h2></h1>
