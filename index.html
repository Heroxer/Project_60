        <h1>Rohit Sharma <br> <h2>Rohit Sharma has an imposing presence at the crease. Not a Chris Gayle-like personality that destroys the bowlers with an astonishing range of shots, but able to make an impact in his own way. Rohit Sharma, a batsman with a combination of silken drives and robust pulls, can be a subject worthy of a case study on how to convert your energy into a successful career.</h2></h1>
